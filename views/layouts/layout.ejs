<!-- Partials: are typically used for small, repetitive HTML elements that are shared across multiple pages. -->

<!-- Custom layouts: are EJS templates that define the overall structure of a website, including the common elements 
that are shared across multiple pages. They are typically used for larger, more complex structures that define
the overall layout of a website. -->

<!-- In this website 2 pages index.ejs and findById.ejs have same partials. So, by writing same partials
in both file. I just created a Custom Layout,so i don't have to write partials in both fiels.  -->

<!-- Instead of defining the same partials in all 10 pages of your website, you can create a custom layout that defines 
the common structure of your website and includes all the necessary partials. This way, you only need to define the 
partials once in the layout, and every page that uses the layout will automatically include them. -->
